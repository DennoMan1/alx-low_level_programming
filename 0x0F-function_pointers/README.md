# 0x0F-function_pointers
Function pointers point to a code and not data unlike the pointers and also 
unlike pointers we do not allocate de-allocate memory using function pointers 
in these projects i will be dealing with:
1. A function that prints a name.
2. A function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
3. A function that searches for an integer.
4. A program that performs simple operations. ie
 +: addition
-: subtraction
*: multiplication
/: division
%: modulo
5. A program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
